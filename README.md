# eg1311-project
The code for our homegrown Arduino robot, for the EG1311 module.

Our team consisted of 2 Computer Engineering students (including me), 1 Mechanical Engineering student, 1 Industrial Systems Engineering student, and 2 Architecture students.

This robot was built to traverse height obstacles, before detecting a wall and stopping. Then, it throws a ping-pong ball over the wall, and reverses back to its starting point.

To control the motors to move in both directions, we had to use the L293D motor driver in a clever manner, different from the schematics given for the template robot.

To detect the wall and stop in front of it, we used an ultrasonic sensor module.

Our robot completed all the challenges perfectly, obtaining 9/10. (The last point is a bonus point for the lightest robot in the lab group.)
